REAL DATA AUDIT REPORT

  Executive Summary

  You're absolutely correct - there's significant use of simulated/demo data throughout the codebase that needs to be replaced with real market data sources. Here's my comprehensive audit:

  ---
  📊 CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND

  1. Core Demo Data File

  File: /src/lib/demo-data.ts
  - Issue: Central demo data generator creating fake portfolio, positions, and market data
  - Impact: ⚠️ HIGH - Core data source is completely simulated
  - Real Data Needed: Live portfolio data from Alpaca/MooMoo APIs

  2. AI Thoughts Generation

  Files:
  - /src/services/ai-thoughts-service.ts
  - /src/services/ai-thoughts-translator.ts
  - Issue: Pre-written arrays of "AI thoughts" instead of real ML model outputs
  - Example: Hardcoded phrases like "🤖 I'm analyzing AAPL momentum patterns with 87% confidence"
  - Impact: ⚠️ HIGH - AI transparency feature is fake
  - Real Data Needed: Actual ML model decision reasoning from IPCA/ensemble models

  3. Autonomous Trading Service

  File: /src/services/autonomous-trading-service.ts
  - Issue: Simulated trading decisions and P&L calculations
  - Example: generateRandomTrade() creates fake buy/sell decisions
  - Impact: ⚠️ HIGH - Trading engine using fake signals
  - Real Data Needed: Real ML predictions from implemented IPCA model

  4. Alternative Data Pipeline

  File: /src/lib/ml/alternative-data-pipeline.ts
  - Issue: Mock data generation for sentiment, news, and economic indicators
  - Example: generateMockSentimentData(), generateMockNewsData()
  - Impact: ⚠️ MEDIUM - ML models training on fake alternative data
  - Real Data Needed: Real Twitter API, news feeds, FRED economic data

  5. Portfolio Service

  File: /src/services/portfolio-service.ts
  - Issue: Demo portfolio calculations instead of broker API calls
  - Impact: ⚠️ HIGH - Portfolio values not reflecting real broker data
  - Real Data Needed: Direct integration with Alpaca/MooMoo portfolio APIs

  🔌 API ENDPOINTS WITH SIMULATED DATA

  MooMoo API Endpoints (All Simulated)

  - /api/moomoo/connection/route.ts - Fake connection status
  - /api/moomoo/market-data/route.ts - Simulated price data
  - /api/moomoo/orders/route.ts - Mock order execution
  - /api/moomoo/portfolio/route.ts - Demo portfolio values

  General Trading APIs

  - /api/portfolio/route.ts - Mixed real/demo data
  - /api/trading/orders/route.ts - Simulated order flow

  ---
  ✅ AREAS WITH REAL DATA (Good)

  Alpaca Integration (Mostly Real)

  - /src/services/alpaca-api.ts - ✅ Real broker API calls
  - /api/alpaca/portfolio/route.ts - ✅ Live portfolio data
  - /api/alpaca/orders/route.ts - ✅ Real order execution

  ML Engine

  - /src/services/ml-engine.ts - ✅ Uses real market data for training
  - /src/lib/ml/ipca-factor-model.ts - ✅ Real mathematical models
  - /api/ml/predictions/route.ts - ✅ Real ML predictions (but may use demo training data)

  ---
  🎯 PRIORITY FIXES NEEDED

  🔥 CRITICAL (Must Fix First)

  1. Replace Demo Data File - /src/lib/demo-data.ts
    - Currently generates all fake portfolio/position data
    - Replace with real Alpaca API calls
  2. Real AI Thoughts - /src/services/ai-thoughts-service.ts
    - Convert hardcoded phrases to real ML model explanations
    - Generate thoughts from actual IPCA factor analysis
  3. Autonomous Trading Logic - /src/services/autonomous-trading-service.ts
    - Replace generateRandomTrade() with real ML predictions
    - Use actual IPCA model outputs for trading decisions

  ⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY

  4. MooMoo API Implementation - All /api/moomoo/* endpoints
    - Currently return mock data
    - Need real MooMoo SDK integration
  5. Alternative Data Sources - /src/lib/ml/alternative-data-pipeline.ts
    - Replace mock sentiment with real Twitter/Reddit APIs
    - Connect to real news feeds (Alpha Vantage, Polygon, etc.)
    - Use real FRED economic data

  📈 MEDIUM PRIORITY

  6. Market Data Service - /src/services/market-data-service.ts
    - Verify using real-time price feeds
    - May have fallback to simulated data
  7. Technical Analysis - /src/services/technical-analysis.ts
    - Check if indicators calculated on real vs demo price data

  💡 RECOMMENDED REAL DATA SOURCES

  Market Data

  - ✅ Alpaca API - Already integrated
  - 🔄 MooMoo HK API - Needs real implementation
  - 📊 Alpha Vantage - For additional market data
  - 📈 Polygon.io - Professional market data

  News & Sentiment

  - 🐦 Twitter API v2 - Real sentiment analysis
  - 📰 NewsAPI - Financial news feeds
  - 📊 FRED API - Economic indicators
  - 🔍 Google Trends API - Search volume data

  Alternative Data

  - 🏢 SEC EDGAR API - Company filings
  - 📊 Economic Calendar APIs - Real economic events
  - 🌐 Social Media Scrapers - Real sentiment data

  🚨 IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

  The platform currently presents itself as "AI-transparent" with "real-time" data, but much of the core functionality is running on simulated data. This creates a credibility gap that needs immediate
  attention.

  Most Critical Files to Address:
  1. /src/lib/demo-data.ts - Remove entirely, replace with real APIs
  2. /src/services/ai-thoughts-service.ts - Generate from real ML models
  3. /src/services/autonomous-trading-service.ts - Use real trading signals
  4. All /api/moomoo/* endpoints - Implement real MooMoo integration

  Status: Ready to implement real data integration strategy 🎯
