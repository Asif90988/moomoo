## 📋 Contribution Guidelines

### Code Standards

**TypeScript & React**
```typescript
// Use descriptive variable names
const aiConfidenceLevel = 87.3;

// Add proper types
interface NeuralNode {
  id: string;
  confidence: number;
  sentiment: 'bullish' | 'bearish' | 'neutral';
}

// Comment complex logic
// Calculate neural network strength based on market volatility
const networkStrength = calculateNeuralStrength(marketData);
```

**Component Structure**
```typescript
// Follow this pattern for new components
const ComponentName: React.FC<Props> = ({ prop1, prop2 }) => {
  // 1. State and hooks
  const [state, setState] = useState();
  
  // 2. Effects
  useEffect(() => {
    // Side effects
  }, []);
  
  // 3. Event handlers
  const handleClick = () => {
    // Handle events
  };
  
  // 4. Render
  return (
    <div className="component-wrapper">
      {/* JSX content */}
    </div>
  );
};
```

**Styling Guidelines**
```css
/* Use Tailwind utility classes */
<div className="bg-neural-dark border border-neon-blue/20 rounded-xl p-4">

/* Custom CSS only when necessary */
.neural-grid {
  background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(59, 130, 246, 0.1) 1px, transparent 1px);
}
```

### AI Transparency Requirements

All AI-related features must:
1. **Show confidence levels** - Users must see how confident the AI is
2. **Explain reasoning** - Provide human-readable explanations
3. **Display risk assessment** - Show what could go wrong
4. **Update in real-time** - Keep information current
5. **Be educational** - Help users learn about AI trading

### Commit Message Format

Use conventional commits:
```bash

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

### Transparency First
Every feature should make the AI more transparent:
- Show AI decision processes
- Display confidence levels
- Explain reasoning in human terms
- Provide educational context

### Educational Focus
Help users learn:
- How AI trading works
- Risk management principles
- Market analysis techniques
- Trading psychology

### User Protection
Prioritize user safety:
- Maintain $300 deposit limit
- Provide clear risk warnings
- Implement circuit breakers
- Offer paper trading mode

### Visual Innovation
Push creative boundaries:
- Unique visualizations (neural networks, trains, etc.)
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Creative use of color and space
- Innovative information display

## 🧪 Testing Guidelines

### Unit Tests
```typescript
// Test AI components
describe('NeuralNode', () => {
  it('should display confidence level correctly', () => {
    const node = { confidence: 87.3, symbol: 'AAPL' };
    render(<NeuralNode {...node} />);
    expect(screen.getByText('87%')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```

### Integration Tests
```typescript
// Test real-time features
describe('AI Thoughts Ticker', () => {
  it('should update when new thoughts arrive', async () => {
    const { getByTestId } = render(<AIThoughtsTicker />);
    
    // Simulate AI thought
    act(() => {
      aiThoughtsService.broadcastThought(mockThought);
    });
    
    await waitFor(() => {
      expect(getByTestId('thought-content')).toHaveTextContent(mockThought.message);
    });
  });
});
```
