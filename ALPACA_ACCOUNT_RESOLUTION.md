## üîç **WHAT THIS MEANS**

The 403 "Forbidden" error with `{"message": "forbidden."}` typically indicates:

1. **Account Verification Incomplete** - KYC (Know Your Customer) not finished
2. **Account Not Approved** - Waiting for Alpaca approval
3. **Account Restrictions** - Trading or API access disabled
4. **Funding Requirements** - Some accounts need minimum funding for API access

---

## üéØ **IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN**

### **Step 1: Check Your Alpaca Dashboard**
1. **Log into your Alpaca account** at [alpaca.markets](https://alpaca.markets)
2. **Look for any notifications** or alerts on your dashboard
3. **Check account status** - should show "Active" or "Approved"
4. **Verify all required information** is complete

### **Step 2: Account Verification Checklist**
Check if these are complete in your dashboard:

- [ ] **Personal Information** (Name, Address, Phone, Email)
- [ ] **Identity Verification** (Government ID uploaded and approved)
- [ ] **Employment Information** (Job, Income, Net Worth)
- [ ] **Investment Experience** (Trading experience, objectives)
- [ ] **Tax Information** (SSN for US residents)
- [ ] **Account Funding** (Some accounts require minimum deposit)

### **Step 3: Contact Alpaca Support**
**This is likely the fastest solution**
